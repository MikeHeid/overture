## What is it?

When you run AI coding agents (for example several Claude Code sessions),
they keep needing **decisions** from you. Which database should we use? How
many retries? Which region? Today each agent stops and waits in its own
terminal. Your answer then disappears when the session ends.

**Overture gathers all those questions into one inbox you open in a
browser**, on your laptop or your phone.

1. **An agent asks.** It lists the options, marks the one it recommends (★),
   and shows the code that matters.
2. **You answer.** Tap an option, or answer a whole batch from the keyboard.
   Lock it when you're sure.
3. **Every agent remembers it.** Locked answers are saved into your project's
   own git history. If the code they relied on later changes, the answer is
   flagged **stale**, so you are never relying on a decision whose code has
   since changed.

</picture>

Most capabilities in [What you can do](#what-you-can-do) come with a screenshot
or short animation.

It docks beside any page you already have. The screenshots show it next to a
project dashboard: waves, phases and lanes, with a live count of open
questions on each card. It runs on your own machine behind your own login,
and nothing goes to a third-party service.

## Who is it for?

- **Solo developers running several AI agents** who are tired of
  babysitting terminals.
- **Tech leads** who want a written record of *why* the code is the way it
  is.
- **Anyone juggling several projects.** One page shows what is waiting for you
  across all of them.

## Try it

You need Claude Code and a Cloudflare account. The free tier is enough; it
provides the login page that protects your inbox.

    /plugin marketplace add MikeHeid/overture
    /plugin install overture@overture
    /overture:console-onboard

The last command walks you through the rest, in your project. The full
details are under [Install](#install).

**Already running Overture for another project?** Join this one to the same
server instead of starting a second one: [docs/JOIN.md](docs/JOIN.md).

## Words you'll see

| Word | Plain meaning |
|---|---|
| **Question** | Something an agent needs you to decide, with options and a recommended pick (★). |
| **Lock** | "I'm sure." A locked answer becomes a lasting rule that every agent follows. |
| **Ruling** | A locked answer. |
| **Stale** | The code a ruling relied on has changed. Take another look. |
| **Steward** | The one agent session that collects your answers and writes them into the project. |
| **Round** | A batch of related questions you answer in one go. |
| **Seats** | Optional advisor agents (security, UX, devil's advocate) that weigh in before you decide. They never decide for you. |

## Where it's going

| Stage | What it means for you | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Wave 1: one person, many agents** | Inbox, rulings, stale warnings, multi-project view, automation | ✅ Shipped (v0.7 → v1.31) |
| **Wave 2: faster setup, stronger rules** | Install in under 10 minutes without Cloudflare; a broken ruling can block a bad merge | 🟡 ~15% |
| **Wave 3: teams** | Several people with roles; every decision records who made it | 🟠 ~10% |
| **Wave 4: an open standard** | Other agent tools (not just Claude) can ask and read rulings | ⚪ ~5% |

The detailed roadmap, with five development lanes, progress estimates and the
reasoning behind them, is in [docs/STRATEGY.md](docs/STRATEGY.md). That
document also covers what makes Overture hard to copy and why it could change
how teams build with AI.

---

This README describes the kit as it is today. [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
says what each release added. Everything below is the full reference.

## Install

Two routes. Both end at `/overture:console-onboard`.

### A. Straight from this repository (no download)

In Claude Desktop's **Code** tab or in `claude`:

    /plugin marketplace add MikeHeid/overture
    /plugin install overture@overture

Then, in your project:

    /overture:console-onboard

Updates land with:

    /plugin marketplace update overture
    /plugin update overture@overture

### B. From a release zip

Get **`overture-<version>.zip`** from
[Releases](https://github.com/MikeHeid/overture/releases). Unzip it
somewhere it can stay (it makes a `overture/` folder). Then:

    /plugin marketplace add ~/overture
    /plugin install overture@overture-local
    /overture:console-onboard

Updates: delete `~/overture/`, unzip the new release zip in its place,
then:

    /plugin marketplace update overture-local
    /plugin update overture@overture-local

A one-liner for scripts, including other Claude sessions:

    rm -rf ~/overture && \
      gh release download --repo MikeHeid/overture --pattern 'overture-*.zip' \
        --dir /tmp --clobber && \
      unzip -q /tmp/overture-*.zip -d ~ && rm /tmp/overture-*.zip

Then run the two `/plugin` commands above and restart the session.

### Upgrade the agent server on each onboarded project

Updating the plugin only refreshes the files on disk; the running Python
server does not pick them up until it restarts. For every project that was
onboarded, run the installer with `--start` to copy the fresh kit to
`~/.local/share/overture/kit/` and restart the systemd user units:

    bash ~/overture/plugins/overture/kit/deploy/install.sh \
      --project <path to project> --start

(When using route A, the path is the plugin cache instead; the install
script's path is printed by `onboard.py show` on the project.)

After the restart, verify from the project's machine:

    curl -s http://127.0.0.1:$(grep ^CONSOLE_PORT .overture/console.env | cut -d= -f2)/health
    # → {"ok": true, "version": "<the version you just installed>", ...}

The first Claude session in each project after the upgrade prints a short
banner naming the new version and the commands most useful at that moment
(`items-push`, `items-watch`, `scaffold-dashboard`, `sync-dashboard`,
`page-snapshot`, `prs-push`, `inbox`).

## Name the session, bootstrap the dashboard

**Set the agent id for a Claude session** — type this in Claude Code:

    /overture:as my-agent-name

The name is recorded against this session in `STATE/sessions.jsonl`. Every
`agent.py` call the session makes signs with it, questions and messages are
attributed to it, and the SessionStart banner knows which session is which.
`OVERTURE_AGENT=my-agent-name` in the shell env is a machine-wide fallback;
`/overture:as` wins for that session.

**Bootstrap the dashboard** — in a terminal on the project's machine:

    # Writes docs/console/page.html with Header / Items / Rollout / Engine / Spec
    # sections and injects a matching board() into .overture/adapter.py.
    agent.py --state <STATE> scaffold-dashboard --project .

    # Insert a <details data-ck-item="X"> stub for every item not yet on the
    # page, nested under its parent. Idempotent; hand-edits inside each node
    # survive re-syncs.
    agent.py --state <STATE> items-push --adapter .overture/adapter.py \
      --sync-dashboard docs/console/page.html

    # Commit, snapshot, press "Use this page" in the console.
    git add -A && git commit -m "dashboard: scaffold + sync"
    agent.py --state <STATE> page-snapshot --path docs/console/page.html

    # Keep the live values fresh:
    agent.py --state <STATE> items-watch --adapter .overture/adapter.py

**Make it more beautiful.** The console inherits CSS custom properties from the
host page's `:root`. Define any of these to re-skin the whole kit (an unlayered
host `:root` beats the kit's `@layer console-fallbacks`):

    :root {
      --c-bg: #...;  --c-surface: #...;  --c-surface-alt: #...;
      --c-fg: #...;  --c-fg-muted: #...;
      --c-border: #...;  --c-border-light: #...;
      --c-accent: #...;  --c-accent-fg: #...;
      --c-open: #...;    --c-open-bg: #...;
      --c-claimed: #...; --c-claimed-bg: #...;
      --c-built: #...;   --c-built-bg: #...;
      --c-blocked: #...; --c-blocked-bg: #...;
      --c-deferred: #...; --c-deferred-bg: #...;
      --radius-sm: 6px;  --radius-md: 10px;
    }
    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { :root:not([data-theme="light"]) { ... } }

The 0.9.11 fallback palette is Primer-aligned (`#0969da` accent on light,
`#58a6ff` on dark) and ships `color-scheme` so native scrollbars match. Then:

- Add deep links from the item view to your dashboard by setting
  `sections` in `.overture.json`:
  `{"sections": {"AB-2": ["#features/rollout", "#features/timeline"]}}`.
  The item view renders chips linking to each anchor.
- Add in-place state badges by marking any `<section data-ck-item="X">`
  on the dashboard. The console injects a `"X ◐ 2 ◑ 1 ◌ 3 ○ 4"` badge
  in-place, updated on every live wake; clicking it opens the panel on X.

## Hooks the plugin ships (doorbell + command guards)

The plugin runs three hooks in every Claude session on your machine. All three
act only in projects that `agent.py register` has entered in your user-level
registry (`~/.config/overture/projects.json`); in any other project they
print nothing and exit 0.

| Hook event | File | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` (startup/resume/clear/compact/fork) | `plugin/hooks/session_start.py` | Reads the doorbell for this project's console and prints what the owner sent while no session was watching: questions, process requests, chat replies, scan requests, visual requests, each with its seq and the command to handle it. On first run after an install or an upgrade, prints a banner naming the running kit version and the commands most useful at that moment. |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `plugin/hooks/name_session.py` | Picks up `/overture:as NAME` and records the mapping `session_id → agent name` in `STATE/sessions.jsonl` (atomic rewrite). The next `agent.py` call reads the name from this file. |
| `PreToolUse` (matcher: `AskUserQuestion`) | `plugin/hooks/ask_guard.py` | On a non-steward session in a project that names a steward, refuses `AskUserQuestion` so the question goes to the owner through the console instead of a transient prompt. |

All three are stdlib-only, read-only outside their known files, and never run
anything from the repository. See the module docstrings for the trust model.

## What you can do

### Answer, lock, and ask for a round

- **Answer and lock.** Each question shows its options, the ★ and whose
  recommendation it is, and evidence rows. The evidence shows the cited lines
  as they are now, and says whether they changed since the question was asked.
  Your own words on an answer travel with it. Locking turns an answer into a
  ruling. A round's questions open as one form: ←/→ to move, 1–9 to pick, then
  **Lock all & process**.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/feature-answer.png" alt="A question card: options with descriptions, the recommended pick starred, cited file, a box for your own words" width="400">

- **Lock with one tap.** **Lock this answer** sends the lock immediately
  (0.9.12). If the server refuses it (e.g. a condition is no longer true),
  the question card shows the reason and the Lock button comes back.
- **Lock several at once.** When an item has more than one answered, unlocked
  question, **Lock all N answers…** shows every answer it is about to lock,
  then locks them in order and stops at the first refusal, naming it.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/anim-lock-all.gif" alt="Lock all 2 answers: the confirmation lists both answers, then both lock" width="400">

- **A round moves on by itself.** Pick a single-choice option and, after a
  moment, the form moves to the next question still without a pick, and says
  so. It stays put for multiple choice, for a question you are writing words
  on, and for ↑/↓ through the options. It never moves onto the Lock page.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/anim-round.gif" alt="Answering a three-question round from the keyboard: press 1 for each, review, Lock all and process" width="400">

- **Answer these together.** Loose questions on one item, asked by one named
  agent session within five minutes of each other, are grouped in the inbox
  and open as one form. Unnamed sessions are never grouped, because nothing
  shows they are one agent's.
- **Send to agent.** Once you have answered something, a bar under the panel
  header shows "N answered · M left" and sends the agent the same "process
  them" signal as before. It goes once sent and comes back with the next
  answer.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/feature-send.png" alt="The Send to agent bar: 1 answered, 0 left" width="400">

- **Locked questions roll up** to one line (question, pick, state). Click or
  press Enter to open one. Open and stale questions stay whole. The slides and
  fades run only when your system does not ask for reduced motion.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/feature-locked.png" alt="An item whose locked question has rolled up to a single line" width="400">

- **Deliberate before answering.** On an open question, pick one to three
  seats (DevOps, UX, adversarial, security, architect, analyst, or one you
  name). They reply with a ★ and their reasons, and never answer or lock for
  you. The cost is shown first, at about 100k tokens a seat.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/feature-deliberate.png" alt="The deliberation form: focus, explore or tighten, an optional note, Start the deliberation" width="400">

- **Next step ▾** beside every locked answer:
  - **Follow up**: chosen seats look at that answer again.
  - **Roar**: a three-round panel, at most once per lock.
  - **Refine** or **Drill**: runs the skill your project names, by default
    the plugin's own `overture:refine` and `overture:drill`.

  Each step comes back as questions for you to lock. Nothing is written into
  the project before you lock.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/feature-next-step.png" alt="A locked answer with Next step open: Follow up, Refine, Drill" width="400">

- **Status flowchart on every item.** Each item view carries a collapsible
  **Status flowchart** that the server builds from your questions and rounds:
  the item at the left, open/stale/locked questions coloured, rounds as their
  own shape, dotted edges where a newer question supersedes an older one or
  a round follows up on an earlier one. It is lazy (nothing loads until you
  expand it) and renders inside the same sandboxed Mermaid frame as a
  requested visual. **Click a node** to jump straight to that question's card
  (or open an item if it is an item node).

  <img src="docs/screenshots/anim-flowchart.gif" alt="Expanding an item's status flowchart, zooming in, and fitting it back to the frame" width="400">

- **Project map** at the top of the Inbox: a tree of every item, parent to
  child, each node coloured by its own questions' roll-up (open > stale >
  answered-but-unlocked > locked) with a short tally. Click an item to open
  it. A chip row narrows the map to one state; ancestors stay drawn muted so
  the tree is still a tree. Lazy, like the per-item chart.
- **Save SVG** on every chart and Mermaid visual. The rendered SVG is sent
  back to the parent and downloaded as a plain file; nothing goes back to
  the server.
- **Request a visual** on an item. The agent answers with a Mermaid diagram
  (rendered right there inside a sandboxed frame — the vendored lib runs in an
  opaque origin and cannot touch the console's cookies, storage or network;
  **View source** still shows the raw `.mmd`), or with an HTML mock shown the
  same way, scripts off entirely.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/feature-visual.png" alt="An agent's Mermaid diagram of a retry flow, rendered in the console with zoom and Save SVG" width="400">

- **A short chime when a visual arrives**, the drawn item surfaces at the top
  of the Inbox under **New visuals**, and the Feed row says "Visual drawn".
  The badge on the inbox button and the Feed tab counts it too, until you look.
- **Star what matters.** Tap ☆ on a visual or an item (the item view's title
  bar, the Inbox row, the New visuals row). The **Favorite** tab lists them,
  grouped by item, newest first. Only the owner can star.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/feature-favorite.png" alt="The Favorite tab listing two starred items" width="400">

- **Chat**, for a message not tied to a question. It wakes the watching
  session. On an item, **💬 Chat ▾** jumps to that item's discussion. Its
  menu offers **Branch out**, **Grill**, **Advise** (deliberate) and
  **Delegate**, each already scoped to the item.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/feature-chat.png" alt="The Chat tab: the owner asks if main is green, the steward answers" width="400">

  <img src="docs/screenshots/feature-chat-menu.png" alt="The Chat ▾ menu on an item: Branch out, Grill, Advise, Delegate" width="400">

### Keep rulings honest as the code moves

A question says what must stay true for its answer to stand (`valid_if`):
cited text (an `excerpt`), a whole file (`file_sha256`), or an item's status.
When that stops holding, the answer reads **stale** and **What changed?** says
which check failed, with a diff of the cited text against the file as it is now.

<img src="docs/screenshots/anim-stale.gif" alt="A stale ruling: What changed? shows the cited line was edited from automated to manual" width="400">

- **Still holds: re-lock…** keeps your answer and re-checks it against the
  files as they are now.
- **`agent.py reanchor`** (the steward runs it, `--dry-run` first) turns a
  stale whole-file hash into an excerpt only with evidence: the question names
  a line range in that file, the steward's pushed history holds the version
  it was locked against, and those lines are still in the file exactly once.
  Anything else stays stale, with the reason listed.
- **Withdraw…**: the ruling no longer applies, and you give a reason.
- **Keep, stop checking…**: the ruling stands, but is no longer checked
  against the files.
- **Confirm a proposed anchor.** The steward proposes new lines for the
  ruling to rest on, the server reads them itself, and nothing changes until
  you press Confirm.
- **Replace.** A new question is linked to the stale one. The old ruling
  stands until you lock the new answer.

Only the owner can do any of these, and only on a stale answer. Nothing is
deleted: each act is recorded in a file beside the store, and the fold records the
outcome in your project. New questions are refused a whole-file hash where an
excerpt fits, which is what made most rulings go stale.

### Track work as tickets

Tickets are small units of work that belong to an item: a **task**, a **bug**,
a **research** question, or a **grilling** note. You create them on an
item's panel. Launch Idea and Branch Out create them for you.

- **Blocking.** A ticket can be blocked by other tickets. Circular blocking
  is refused by name. When a blocker closes, everything it blocked
  unblocks.
- **The Tickets tab** (`g k`) is a board across every item, with Open,
  Blocked and Closed columns and a filter by kind. Each card names its
  item, opens it with a click, and says what blocks it by title.
- **What blocks what** draws the chains as a diagram, grouped by item. It
  is there for the whole project on the Tickets tab, and for one item on
  that item's panel.

<img src="docs/screenshots/anim-tickets.gif" alt="Closing a blocking ticket: Ledger schema closes and Migration for the ledger moves from Blocked to Open" width="400">

<img src="docs/screenshots/feature-ticket-graph.png" alt="What blocks what: tickets grouped by item, arrows from blocker to blocked, blocked tickets outlined in red" width="400">

Only you create and close tickets. Agents cannot write them yet; that
waits on the capability gate.

### Your dashboard, published by you

The console can sit inside your project's own dashboard page. An agent
stages a page from a merged commit (`agent.py page-snapshot`). The console
then shows it as a proposal, with its ref, commit, size and a sandboxed
preview. It is served only after you press **Use this page**. No agent can
publish, and the "reviewed" label is shown as the agent's claim, because the
server cannot check it.

### See what's happening

- The page updates itself, with no reload. A box you're typing in is never
  redrawn under you.
- The **Inbox** shows what waits for you, with an unread count. The **Feed**
  shows every question, answer, lock and reply, newest first.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/feature-feed.png" alt="The Feed tab: chat, visuals and questions, newest first, filterable by kind and item" width="400">

- The status bar says whether an agent session is listening right now.
  Optionally, a footer shows your Claude usage for the 5-hour and 7-day
  windows.
- **Several agents, one console.** Sessions can be named (`/overture:as
  agent-6`). One of them, the **steward**, named in your own registry, is the
  only one that processes your requests and folds your answers. The others
  post their questions to your inbox instead of asking you directly.
- The **PRs** tab shows each pull request as its own card. The left edge
  shows its state: blue open, amber checks running, red checks failing,
  gray draft, purple merged. It lists the project's open pull requests, then those
  merged or closed in the last 30 days (`--days` changes it), with checks, draft and merged
  badges, a link to each on GitHub, and an **Open** button for any item or
  question a title or branch names. The steward pushes the list
  (`agent.py prs-push`), and the tab says when it last did.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/feature-prs.png" alt="The PRs tab: two open pull requests and three merged, each with checks and an Open button for its item" width="400">

- The **Favorite** tab lists everything you starred, grouped by item.
- **Cross-project priority ribbon.** The Inbox opens with up to six of the
  oldest awaiting questions across every console (self + each portfolio
  peer), each with a traffic-light dot (yellow < 1h, orange < 24h,
  red > 24h). Click a row to jump — local items open their panel; peer
  rows open the peer in a new tab.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/feature-priority.png" alt="The priority ribbon: six questions waiting, oldest first, each with a traffic-light dot and a snooze button" width="400">

- **Command palette.** Press **Ctrl+K** / **Cmd+K** on any page to open a
  search box over items, questions, playbooks, peers, tabs and actions.
  Type a few characters, press Enter: jumps to an item, runs a playbook,
  opens a peer in a new tab, or hops a tab.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/anim-palette.gif" alt="Pressing Ctrl+K, typing retry, and jumping straight to the matching item" width="720">

- **Keyboard shortcuts.** Press `?`, or the **⌨ Shortcuts** button in the
  footer, for the full list.
  `g i / f / k / p / s / o / c` hop to the Inbox / Feed / Tickets / PRs /
  Favorite / Portfolio / Chat tab, `g b` closes the panel, `.` focuses the
  Delegate bar, `j / k` walk the rows, Enter / Space opens the focused
  row. Shortcuts never fire in a text input.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/feature-shortcuts.png" alt="The keyboard shortcuts sheet" width="400">

- The **Portfolio** tab lists every other console you have configured, with
  its state tallies (`?you ~unl !stale ○lock`), last-activity and a click
  that opens it in a new tab. A bell button opts in to desktop
  notifications so a sibling's new `?you` or `!stale` reaches you even
  when the tab is in the background; a Snooze button sets a 1-hour DND
  lid. Peers are declared in `.overture/portfolio.json`; the Cloudflare
  Access service-token secrets live in `STATE/portfolio-secrets/<peer>.json`
  (`agent.py portfolio-token` prints the layout). The home server does the
  cross-origin calls, so the browser never sees a peer's secret.
- A **Back** control sits at the top of every item view, so **discuss** from
  the dashboard always has a one-tap way home.
- **Direction stays visible.** Each item in the Inbox carries a collapsible
  "N answered on this item" under its open questions, showing the last few
  locked rulings on it. Items whose questions are all locked within the last
  day stay on the list under **Recently answered**, so you can see what was
  asked and what you answered without leaving the Inbox.

## How it fits together

```

- **`server.py`** serves the console, inside your published dashboard page if
  you have one. Every request without a valid Access token is refused, loopback
  included. **It runs no project code and no git.** Your work items arrive by
  `agent.py items-push`, git history by `agent.py history-push`, pull
  requests by `agent.py prs-push` (`gh` runs in the steward, never in the
  server), and the page by `agent.py page-snapshot`. The steward runs all
  four in its own process,
  and each sends data the server checks against a closed schema.
- **`agent.py`** is the agent's side. Its commands:

  | Purpose | Commands |
  |---|---|
  | Reading | `inbox`, `todo`, `view`, `answers` (capped at 64 KiB, with a narrower command named when a read is too big), `health` |
  | Asking and answering | `ask`, `reply`, `working`, `synced`, `watch` |
  | Deliberation | `fork-context`, `transcript`, `visual`, `visual-export`, `next-step`, `costs` |
  | Stale answers | `check`, `reanchor`, `propose-anchor` |
  | Pushing data | `items-push`, `history-push`, `prs-push`, `page-snapshot` |
  | Owner only | `register`, `steward`, `server add`, `server token rotate` |

  `--as NAME` names the session.
- **`fold.py`** writes locked answers, and what became of them, into your
  project through its adapter, in the steward's process.
- **`plugin/`** holds the Claude Code plugin: the hook, the skills, and the
  committee agents. Its skills include `roar`, `refine`, `drill` and
  `deliberate`, which a console round uses and which also run on their own
  (`/overture:roar` and so on).
- **`onboard.py`** and **`deploy/`** onboard a project and install the
  services.

### What a project token protects

One console server can host several projects. Each project's agents reach it
with that project's own token. The token is kept in
`~/.config/overture/tokens/NAME` (mode 0600, outside every repository);
`server.json` holds only its hash. `agent.py` picks the project from the
directory it runs in. `agent.py server token rotate NAME` (which you run)
refuses the old token from the next request.

- **What it stops:** cross-talk and mistakes. A wrong `--state`, a skill bug,
  or an agent carrying another project's habits cannot read or write another
  project's console through the kit.
- **What it does not stop:** an agent running as the same OS user that sets
  out to cross over. It can read `tokens/` and the state directories directly.
  Real isolation needs a sandbox or a separate user.
- **An old per-project server is a way around it.** While one still listens on
  `STATE/agent.sock`, that socket answers without a token. Stop it before
  relying on the token.

## Windows + WSL2 (optional)

The server, the tunnel and the systemd units are POSIX; a convenient layout
on a Windows host is to run them in WSL2 while a Claude Code session lives on
either side. A few traps worth knowing:

- **CRLF.** `git config core.autocrlf=true` on Windows gives every file in
  the plugin cache CRLF endings. `install.sh` then fails at once
  (`set: pipefail: invalid option name`), and systemd unit files with a `\r`
  silently misbehave. Install the kit from a copy stripped of CR (`sed -i
  's/\r$//'` on each `*.sh`, `*.in`, `*.py`, `*.js`, `*.css`, `*.html`) or
  clone with `core.autocrlf=false`.
- **Default branch.** `page-snapshot --from-ref origin/main` is the default
  and fails on a repository whose default is anything else. Pass
  `--from-ref HEAD --unreviewed` while bootstrapping, or point `--from-ref`
  at your actual branch.
- **Page path.** `onboard.py` defaults the page to `.overture/page.html`,
  which `page-snapshot` refuses (leading dot). Move the page under
  `docs/console/page.html` or similar.
- **Items.** The server never runs your adapter. After onboarding, run
  `agent.py --state STATE items-push --adapter PATH` once (and whenever the
  item list changes); until then `ask` on any item but `PROJECT` is refused.
- **Reaching the server from Windows.** The agent socket lives in WSL and
  Windows cannot open a WSL2 Unix socket. Options: run the agent-side session
  inside WSL (`wsl -e bash` wrapper), or use the one-server HTTP door with a
  project token on loopback.
- **Linger.** Systemd user units stop when WSL shuts down. Run
  `loginctl enable-linger $USER` in WSL; a Windows process that keeps WSL
  alive still helps when nothing else holds it.

## Trust

- The plugin's hook runs in every project you open, but acts only in projects
  listed in `~/.config/overture/projects.json`, which only `agent.py
  register` and `agent.py steward` write. A cloned repository's
  `.overture.json` is never trusted by itself, and cannot name a steward.
- Anything an agent can write — the adapter, `.git/config`, the dashboard file
  in the working tree — is never run or read by the server.
- The kit never opens `~/.cloudflared/cert.pem` or a tunnel credentials file.
  It checks that the file exists, and nothing more.
- Nothing onboarding writes is a secret. The AUD tag and team domain are what
  tokens are *checked against*; no token can be made from them.

## Development

    python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
    .venv/bin/python test_kit.py && .venv/bin/python test_server.py && .venv/bin/python test_onboard.py
    .venv/bin/python test_build.py
    OVERTURE_BROWSER=1 .venv/bin/python test_browser.py   # needs playwright + browsers

Three `test_kit.py` compatibility tests start older released kits, so they
need the `v0.8.7` and `v0.8.8` tags; in a shallow or tag-less clone run
`git fetch --tags` first, or they fail and name the missing tag.

`test_server.py`'s syscall tests need `strace`, and FAIL when it is missing,
so they cannot quietly not run. On a machine without it, set
`OVERTURE_NO_STRACE=1` to skip them, and each is then reported, by name, as
not run.

To refresh the README screenshots after a UI change (needs Playwright and
Chromium), run:

    python3 docs/demo/screenshots.py

The script starts the real console server in-process, with a throwaway key
standing in for Cloudflare Access. It publishes `docs/demo/showcase.html`, an
example dashboard with waves, phases and lanes, as the project page. It seeds
questions, rulings, a stale ruling, a round, a visual, chat and PRs through the
same doors agents and the owner use. Then it captures every capability in this
README: stills in `docs/screenshots/feature-*.png`, hero shots in dark and
light, and short GIFs (`anim-*.gif`) of the interactive ones.

To build the release zip:

    python3 build_zip.py --deny-file ~/my-deployment-values.txt

It runs `claude plugin validate --strict` on the result. The deny file lists
strings from your own deployment (hostnames, AUD tags, team domain, home
path), and the build refuses if any of them appears in the zip.
