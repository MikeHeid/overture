    agent.py --state DIR steward [NAME | --clear]
                                                show, set or clear the console's steward in your registry (0.8.3;
                                                you run this, never a session)

**Slim reads (K1).** JSON goes out compact when stdout is not a terminal.
`todo`, `view` and `answers` refuse a read over 64 KiB unless given --full:
they print nothing on stdout, name the narrower command on stderr and exit 4,
since a cut read would look whole.

`register` records, in your own registry (~/.config/overture/projects.json),
the project, this state dir, and the kit this agent.py lives in. The plugin
acts only in registered projects and takes the paths it runs from there, never
from the repository (§7.7).

While `watch` waits it records so in watch.json beside the doorbell, and the
owner's console shows "agent listening" until it exits or stops renewing it.

`watch` exits 0 with the waiting lines, or 3 when --timeout runs out. The
agent's cursor moves only through `synced --through`, and never backwards, so
a signal that arrives while the agent works is not marked processed.

The server stamps every write from this door `by: agent`.

**The one server and project tokens (K4).** When the console is hosted on the
one console server (`server add`), agent.py takes its project from the
directory it runs in: the registered root holding it names the console, and
server.json names that console's project and its token file,
tokens/NAME beside server.json. --state must name that same console, or
nothing is sent; there is no --token and no --project flag. The token file is
read on every call, so `server token rotate` needs no session restart, and the
token is never printed. A console server.json does not host keeps its own
STATE/agent.sock, as before.

**Agent names (0.8.2).** When several sessions share one console, each may
say who it is: `agent.py --as agent-6 ...` (before the subcommand), or
OVERTURE_AGENT=agent-6 in its environment; `--as` wins. The name is 1 to 32
lowercase letters, digits and single hyphens, starting with a letter, and
neither "agent" nor "owner"; anything else is refused by name (exit 2) and
nothing is sent. The owner's console shows it on the questions, replies,
visuals and transcripts this session writes, and `working`/`synced` then keep
and clear this session's own "agent active" marks, never another's. With no
name, everything is exactly as in 0.8.1, and the unnamed sessions share one
set of marks.

**The steward (0.8.3).** The doorbell has one cursor, so when several
sessions share a console, the user may name one of them its steward, in their
own registry: `agent.py --state DIR steward agent-5` (or `register ...
--steward agent-5`). Then `watch` and `synced` (and `fold.py`) refuse, exit 1,
unless this session's name (`--as`, or OVERTURE_AGENT) is the steward's; the
refusal names the steward and points at `ask`, `reply` and `working`, which
stay open to every session, named or not. The repository's `.overture.json`
cannot set it. With no steward, everything is as in 0.8.2. It is a guardrail
between cooperating sessions of one user, not a security boundary: any process
running as that user can edit the registry or the cursor.

**Session names (0.8.4).** The user may name a Claude Code session by typing
`/overture:as agent-5` in it; the plugin records that session's id against
the name in DIR/sessions.jsonl and puts the id in the session's Bash
environment as OVERTURE_SESSION. This session's name is then, in order:
`--as`, the name recorded for OVERTURE_SESSION, OVERTURE_AGENT.
