"""Tickets — lightweight work units hanging off items .

A ticket is a child issue scoped to an item. It is not a Linear/Jira clone: no
workflow engine, no custom fields, no saved views. Overture's tickets exist as the
downstream artifact of Launch Idea and as a place to pin bugs / research / grilling
notes against an item.

Storage shape — a single `STATE/tickets.json` written whole, O_NOFOLLOW, atomic:

    {
      "tickets": {
        "T-aAb3": {
          "id": "T-aAb3",
          "parent_item": "A.1",
          "kind": "task"       | "bug" | "research" | "grilling",
          "title": "...",
          "body": "...",       (may be empty)
          "status": "open"     | "blocked" | "closed",
          "blocked_by": ["T-xYz1", ...],
          "created_at": "...",
          "created_by": "owner" | "agent",
          "agent": "optional agent name on an agent write",
          "closed_at": "...",   (set when status == closed)
          "updated_at": "..."
        }
      }
    }

Trust: this module writes under STATE only. The server never reads a ticket's text
and never exposes it beyond the owner door; a ticket is never emitted to a peer.
Caps keep the file bounded against an agent that writes in a loop:

- Up to `MAX_TICKETS` live rows; above this a create raises `TicketError` by name.
- Each title / body capped at `MAX_TITLE` / `MAX_BODY` characters.
- Blocking is acyclic: a `blocked_by` closure that reaches `id` is refused.
- A write that would make the file exceed `MAX_FILE` is refused by name.
