"""The console page: staged by the steward from a commit, published by the owner (CONSOLE-kit/Q28, Q29).

Before Q28 the server read its page from the project's checkout on every
request and injected the console into it. Any agent that could edit that file
could put a script in the owner's browser, where it could answer and lock as
the owner. Now no server reads a page from a project: not `--page`, not the
one server's `page` entry.

`agent.py page-snapshot` reads the page from a commit with `git cat-file` in
the steward's process, never from the working tree, and refuses a commit that
is not an ancestor of origin/main unless told `--unreviewed`. What it sends is
only STAGED (Q29, "Agents stage, I publish"): kept in STATE/page-staged.json
and never served. The page shows the proposal (ref, commit, size, reviewed or
not), a sandboxed preview, and "Use this page"; only that owner route, behind
the owner's Access login, moves it to STATE/page-snapshot.json, which is the
one page served. No agent route can publish. The server cannot check the
agent-side guards (it runs no git); it re-checks everything it can (the closed
schema, the caps, the injection) at stage time, at publish time, and on every
read.

Both files are read and written relative to a held descriptor of STATE
(`atfile`): opened O_NOFOLLOW|O_NONBLOCK, refused unless a regular file, and
replaced whole by an O_EXCL temporary, an fsync and a rename.
